# Amazon-Bedrock-Document-Generator
This is sample code demonstrating the use of Amazon Bedrock and Generative AI to implement a document generation use case. The application is constructed with a simple streamlit frontend where users can provide details and create a document in the exact format that the you specify.

# **Goal of this Repo:**
The goal of this repo is to provide users the ability to use Amazon Bedrock and generative AI to perform document generation based on a document template and details inputted by the user.
This repo comes with a basic frontend to help users stand up a proof of concept in just a few minutes.

The architecture and flow of the sample application will be:

![Alt text](images/architecture.png "POC Architecture")

When a user interacts with the GenAI app, the flow is as follows:

1. The user inserts document details that they would like included in the generated document within the streamlit app. (app.py).
2. The streamlit app, takes the document details, and invokes Amazon Bedrock to generate sample document that matches the document structure stated in the prompt containing the inserted document details (doc_generator.py).
3. Amazon Bedrock generates a first draft of the sample document and presents it to the frontend (app.py).
4. The user inserts refinement details highlighting areas where they would like to add refinements to the previously generated document (app.py).
5. The streamlit app takes the refinement details, passes it to Amazon Bedrock along with the document prompt, and the original draft of the document to begin creating the refined version (doc_generator.py).
6. Amazon Bedrock is used to generate the refined version of the document based on the user defined refinements and presents it on the frontend (app.py).

# How to use this Repo:

## Prerequisites:
1. Amazon Bedrock Access and CLI Credentials.
2. Ensure Python 3.9 installed on your machine, it is the most stable version of Python for the packages we will be using, it can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3911/).

## Step 1:
The first step of utilizing this repo is performing a git clone of the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-rdoty/Amazon-Bedrock-Document-Generator-POC.git
```

After cloning the repo onto your local machine, open it up in your favorite code editor. The file structure of this repo is broken into 3 key files,
the app.py file, the doc_generator.py file, and the requirements.txt. The app.py file houses the frontend application (a streamlit app). 
The doc_generator.py file houses the logic of the application, including the prompt formatting logic and Amazon Bedrock API invocations.
The requirements.txt file contains all necessary dependencies for this sample application to work.

## Step 2:
Set up a python virtual environment in the root directory of the repository and ensure that you are using Python 3.9. This can be done by running the following commands:
```
pip install virtualenv
python3.9 -m venv venv
```
The virtual environment will be extremely useful when you begin installing the requirements. If you need more clarification on the creation of the virtual environment please refer to this [blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/).
After the virtual environment is created, ensure that it is activated, following the activation steps of the virtual environment tool you are using. Likely:
```
cd venv
cd bin
source activate
cd ../../ 
```
After your virtual environment has been created and activated, you can install all the requirements found in the requirements.txt file by running this command in the root of this repos directory in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3:
Now that the requirements have been successfully installed in your virtual environment we can begin configuring environment variables.
You will first need to create a .env file in the root of this repo. Within the .env file you just created you will need to configure the .env to contain:

```
profile_name=<AWS_CLI_PROFILE_NAME>
```
Please ensure that your AWS CLI Profile has access to Amazon Bedrock!

## Step 4:
As soon as you have successfully cloned the repo, created a virtual environment, activated it, installed the requirements.txt, and created a .env file, your application should be ready to go. 
To start up the application with its basic frontend you simply need to run the following command in your terminal while in the root of the repositories' directory:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
As soon as the application is up and running in your browser of choice you can begin generating documents based on your specific formatting and details, while also being able to add refinements along the way.
